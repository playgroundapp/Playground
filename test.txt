Good... now that everything is working, this is how you get started.


Also, I found this site 100% helpful: http://gitref.org/remotes/




- PULL the MAIN REPOSITORY and PUT IT ON YOUR COMPUUTER
git clone https://github.com/playgroundapp/Playground.git

- If you are adding a NEW FILE:
git add FILENAME

- To PREPARE this file for UPDATEING the MAIN REPOSITORY:
git commit FILENAME -m "TYPE A COMMENT HERE"

- To actually UPDATE the MAIN REPOSITORY:
git push https://github.com/playgroundapp/Playground.git

- If there are errors, you first have to UPDATE YOUR REPOSITORY TO MATCH THE MAIN REPOSITORY:
(I think this is correct ....)
git fetch https://github.com/playgroundapp/Playground.git
git merge https://github.com/playgroundapp/Playground.git/master

- Equivalently, you could use:
git pull https://github.com/playgroundapp/Playground.git/master




- Check out all the commits that were made to a file:
git log FILENAME

- See line by line who made changes to a file:
git blame FILENAME
